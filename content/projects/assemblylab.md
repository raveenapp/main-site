This project was completed while working as an Educational Assistant for the Mechanical Engineering Department at McMaster. The purpose of this lab was to teach students about design techniques when 3D printing and laser cutting. I was tasked with designing a car which utilized different kinds of parts or fasteners. Some parts were purposefully designed to be combursome to highlight the importance of design for assembly. The students then would assemble the kit and comment on what designed components worked well and didn't work well. 

Some of the design techniques considered:
- The importance of 3D printing orientation (considering layer lines)
- Securing motors with fasteners and nuts
- Using a fastener as axle
- Using a set screw to secure a rotating object
- Using a pulley as a trasmission

The individual lab was created used PLA 3D printed components, acrylic laser cut pieces and common fasteners.
