This was my first year group design project. The goal of the project was to design a gear train that would move two fingers open and close. We were constrained to a given area and we were also given a specific gear ratio that our train had to be.

There was a lot to learn from this project. This was my first design project so I expected to have hiccups, those hiccups turned out to bite the group in the butt later. First, when it comes to design, we made the mistake of thinking our physical model would be constrained the same way as the CAD model. Things were haphazardly put together using superglue which could have been avoided if the model was designed better. The same applies to the gears, set screws could have been used to better locate them on an axle. 

This project was still an important part of my learning cause I confidently believe you learn the most in your mistakes.
