## The Goal
The goal of this project is to get better with Python. I learned Python in my first year programming class and used a little bit over the years, but I would hesitate to say I have a "functional" knowledge of the language. My goal with this project is to develop a better foundation so I can apply it better. 

## 1.0 Python Docs
I am going to start with working through the Python docs (https://docs.python.org/3.11/tutorial/index.html) to learn the basics again. Will update when I make more progress.
