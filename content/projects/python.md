# The Goal
The goal of this project is to get better with Python. I learned Python in my first year programming class and used a little bit over the years, but I would hesitate to say I have a "functional" knowledge of the language. My goal with this project is to develop a better foundation so I can apply it better. To start I am going to be working through ForrestKnight's "Open Source Python Course" (https://github.com/ForrestKnight/open-source-cs-python). From there, I hope to have the knowledge to build into my own projects.

# 1.0 Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python) [In Progress]
This is a course created by the University of Michigan and hosted on Coursera. This is the one I am starting with. I am familiar with a lot of the basics because of my first year course and other coding projects, but I think its still good to run through.
