 My name is Raveen Appuhamy. I graduated from Mechanical Engineering & Management at McMaster University. I will be returning to school to begin my Masters in Applied Science in Mechanical Engineering in January.

I am also a licensed glider pilot and been a glider instructor since 2016. I fly with the Air Cadet Gliding program.

This website is a mixture of a portflio and a blog of sorts. I'm not a big fan of posting on social media so it's a place to share my thoughts on my own platform!
