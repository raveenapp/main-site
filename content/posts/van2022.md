## Day 1 - The Start
The trip started on a good note before I landed in the city. I had a lovely conversation on the flight with a social worker who was on their way to a conference. After we landed, I made my way to the Sky Train and bought a Compass Card. The Sky Train is the above-ground rail system that runs through Vancouver and the Compass Card is the associated transit pass, but I'll talk about how much I love those later. I board the Expo line towards my friend's apartment and I couldn't get over the view. I faced the mountain line for the entire trip and I was in disbelief. What's even crazier to me is that the locals aren't phased by it. That makes sense, I'm sure people would get used to it if it's all they knew, but coming from Ontario, I couldn't believe my eyes.

I arrive at my friend's apartment and the vibes are great. For context, we haven't seen each other properly since 2019. We would always hang out with our friends together since first year, and in 2019 we both moved cities to go on co-op. Then covid hit, and we haven't been able to see each other since, until now. It was so much fun to reminisce on our shared memories and get to know each other even better.

We got a Lemon Grass Pork Bahn Mi sandwich from the Bahn Mi Bar which was delicious! Highly recommend. After that, we made our way downtown. Just to get a vibe of the city, we decided to walk down towards the Barge Chilling Beach and kept walking for like an hour (a common theme, we did a LOT of walking this week). After our walk we stopped at the CRAFT Beer Market and had a Beach Ave Lager and Mountainview Sour, both were very good. After that, we made our way home and that was the end of Day 1!

## Day 2 - Downtown
On Day 2, we started by visiting Gas Town. We checked out the steam clock and it was cool to see all the mechanical mechanisms in it.

After that, we took a bike ride around Stanley Park.

We got lunch at Horin Ramen (also delicious), recaffinated with a Waves Coffee and then checked out some used bookstores. We went to the Paper Hound where I picked up "The Acid Room" and then stopped at MacLeod's Books where I bought "Ender's Shadow". This was a fantastic idea. We both brought our books on the transit, so we could spend time reading anytime we were talked out. I loved the vibe of MacLeod's, it's exactly the kind of bookstore you could get lost in.

## Day 3 - UBC and Gas Town
Today was a UBC day! We hopped on the transit toward the school. We stumbled on the Nitobe Memorial Garden on the way to the Museum of Anthropology and it was an awesome detour. The whole space was serene and beautiful.

The MOA was cool! It had a lot of pieces from every culture and era. It was fun to walk through history.

After the museum, we stopped at Uncle Faith's Pizza for some lunch and then made out way to Granville Island. We walked around the area to see the sights, picked up some beers and headed home.

## Day 4 - Grouse Mountain
Today was a day I was looking very forward to. We started the day by going to Angela's Dutch Corner, where I had some waffles and coffee. Then we started our 1.5-hour-long journey to the Capilano Suspension Bridge! This was super cool to see and then explore the trails.

We then continued our way north to Grouse Mountain, where we took a gondola to the top. It was pretty snowy up there but surprisingly not as chilly.

## Day 5 - Burnaby
Day 5 was another walking day. My friend had never been to Burnaby yet so we both decided to take a visit in that direction. We took the transit to Simon Fraser University and then walked on the trails to Burnaby Mountain Park. From there, we took the Pandora Trail and Velodrome Trail down back to the city. One restaurant that was constantly recommended to me on social media algorithms was Big Way Hotpot! It was on the pricier side, but a very yummy treat.

## Day 6 - Chill day in the City
Day 6 was the first day we got a different kind of weather other than the sun and clear skies. It was a super foggy day and stayed that way the entire time. My friend and I used it as a sign to take a chill day and relax after all the walking we did. We went to Take Urban Cafe for a coffee. I was told I had to try the seafood while in Vancouver, so we went to Fanny Bay Oyster Bar where I had sablefish and Fanny Bay Oysters (very good!!).

There's a group of Ontario "ex-pats" from my school who left the province and moved to Vancouver. My friend and I got a chance to meet up with them at the Brassneck Brewery and it was a great time.

## Day 7 - Science World!
Knowing tomorrow was going to be a big day, we decided to Day 7 easy too. We walked around New Westminster and then had pho at Pho Qyuhn Express. We finished the day by going to Science World's After Hours event. The whole place was reserved for adults and we got to explore while having some "beverages". A great time!

## Day 8 - Squamish
This was my last full day in Vancouver, and as such, we had to end it with a bang! My friend and I grabbed an Evo and started making our way to Squamish. Driving to Squamish was probably the most fun I've had driving in a long time. The views, the twists and the bends kept every part of the drive fresh and exciting! We stopped at Shannon Falls and then took the Sea to Sky Gondola up the mountain. From there, we took the Panorama Trail and Spirit Trail to see the views around. After we were finished on the mountain, we went to Sunny Chibas Fried Chicken, a fantastic joint in Squamish where I had a Beef Dip sandwich made from Birria beef and consome it. After another awesome drive back to my friend's apartment, we relaxed for a little bit.

{{< figure src="/Van2022/Van2022_31.jpg" width="400px" >}}

We then met up with another friend of mine who I met in Peru back in May. We had sushi at Manna Sushi and caught up. It was super cool to reconnect with someone I had met in another part of the world. I hope do to that again with the other friends I've made.

My friend and I finished the night with a comedy show at Cambrian Hall. We met up with the same McMaster Alum from the night before and it was a blast. There was a variety of comics and they were all hilarious!

## Notes about the Trip
This whole trip was an absolute blast. I think I like the idea of doing a small trip (1 week) and a longer trip (3 weeks) each year. Let's see if that's possible! I also learned how much I still have to see in Canada and I'm so excited about it. I loved Vancouver as a city. It had the big city vibe but with lots of green space and the mountains are right there! I definitely could see myself living there, so we'll have to see what life has to bring.

## Public Transit
I am absolutely in love with Vancouver's public transit system. The Sky Train can take you to all the major locations in the city, and then you can take connecting buses everywhere else. The trains come so frequently that we never checked for the next time, by the time we got to the station, the next train would also be within 5 mins. I really hope to see other cities in Ontario can implement as efficient of a system. I was curious to see the accessibility of Vancouver would compare to Toronto.


## Car Share
Another system I adore is the city's car share system. Because transit is so accessible, it's so unlikely that you would need a car everyday. But on the days you do, the city is partnered with the BCAA to make a car share program. There are a couple in the city but the one I used was Evo. There is a fleet of Toyota Prius available to Evo users at their fingertips. You find the car you want to use, and unlock it from the app. At this point, the car is yours and you can take it anywhere. When you are done, you can park at a selected location near your destination and just leave the car there. So convenient! I really hope similar programs can be introduced in the GTA cause I would absolutely use it.
