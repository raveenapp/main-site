At the start of 2022, I decided to keep a log of all the notiable events throughout the year. It's easy for me to get caught up with the micro aspects of life and this log allowed me to put my year into perspective. To summarize this year, I:
- graduated from undergrad, getting my iron ring
- started gliding again since the pandemic started
- backpacked Peru for 3 weeks
- worked for the Mechanical Engineering department with their techinicians
- was accepted to my mech eng masters program starting in January
- spent a week exploring Vancouver with a friend
- went to 8 concerts
- watched 16 shows, 7 movies and read 6 books
- hung out with countless friends, watched my friend get married, and ate lots of good food

I wouldn't have remembered half of these things if it wasn't for the log I kept, definitely a habit I want to continue into 2023.
