## Background
I had a goal to read 6 novels in 2023, and I started that goal the book "Ender's Shadow" by Orson Scott Card. It's a parallel story to "Ender's Game", revisiting the original book from the perspective of Ender's right hand man, Bean. After finishing that book, I couldn't put the rest of the series down and between January and April, I finished the remaining 6 books.

Before going into my thoughts of the series, I feel like I need to explain a little bit about the Ender Universe. Card first wrote "Ender's Game" in 1985, this marks the beginning of the universe and what is usually called the "Ender Series". After his first book, Card wrote "Speaker of the Dead" in 1986, an indirect sequel which takes place 3000 years after Ender's Game. The following books, "Xenocide" (1991) and "Children of the Mind" (1996) are direct sequels to the second book, continuing right where the last book left off. I finished this series in 2021 and I enjoyed it alot! I loved the first book for its characters, military-esque setting and the univerise it was building. The rest of the series is completely different. It's more philosphical, addressing what it means to be an intelligent species, and asking if the rights of one species supercede another's. Though the ending is a little mystical, I thoroughly enjoyed the series. But this post isn't about the Ender Series, I'll save that for a different post. This is about Cards follow-up series within the same universe, the "Shadow saga". 

As I mentioned before, the first book "Ender's Shadow" was written in 1999. It's a retelling of the first book from Bean, an hyper-intelligent orphan from Rotterdam and his own experiences in Battle School. There are 4 other books in this saga "Shadow of the Hegemon" (2001), "Shadow Puppets" (2002), "Shadow of the Giant" (2005), and "Shadows in Flight" (2002). This series covers the Battle School events from the first book, and then explores what happens to Earth after the war. Since every nation united to fight against the Formics, differences were set aside, sending the world's brightest children to become expert military tacticians. Well, now that the Formics are defeated, and the children return to their respective countries, what happens now? It's not like they can forget their military teaching and return to a regular childhood. The Shadow saga dives into geopolitics, what will the world do once the common enemy is gone? The nations can return back to their fueds and issues and that creates turmoil, since every nation in the world is effectively in an cold war of intelligence. I thought it was super facsinating but I'll get into that later. 

Only to make the universe more confusing, Card eventually releases "Ender in Exile" (2008), which is a direct sequel of "Ender's Game". It's about Ender and his experiences directly after the war. This novel would eventually lead to "Speaker of the Mind". Finally, to wrap it all up, "The Last Shadow" was released in 2021, as the final book concluding the Ender series and the Shadow Saga. There is also a prequel series called the "Formic Wars", which takes place before "Ender's Game", but I haven't read them yet.

## My Thoughts




- i finished the shadow saga by orson scott card
- i read the ender series a couple of years ago
- ender focused more of philosphy - what it means to be an intelligent species, the rights of one species over the other
- it ends up a little mystical 

- shadow series - was more about geopolitics, once the common enemy of the world gone, what do
- how to unite the world, and the trials that come up
- the end of series turns more "scientific"

- the last book even more mystical, but a good ending

- the series shines for its interpersonal issues, card does a good job of taking characteristics of nations, predicting the future of them and the basing the story off that
- i love bean, and him growing. I love petra, the ending of the earth arc was sad, peters growth great

- bean dealing with his kids was interesting
