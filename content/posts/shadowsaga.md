- i finished the shadow saga by orson scott card
- i read the ender series a couple of years ago
- ender focused more of philosphy - what it means to be an intelligent species, the rights of one species over the other
- it ends up a little mystical 

- shadow series - was more about geopolitics, once the common enemy of the world gone, what do
- how to unite the world, and the trials that come up
- the end of series turns more "scientific"

- the last book even more mystical, but a good ending

- the series shines for its interpersonal issues, card does a good job of taking characteristics of nations, predicting the future of them and the basing the story off that
- i love bean, and him growing. I love petra, the ending of the earth arc was sad, peters growth great

- bean dealing with his kids was interesting
