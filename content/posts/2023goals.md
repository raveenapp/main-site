## fitness
- go to the gym for 200 days this year - I don't have a goal with weight or strength, I just want to keep consistent
- Go on a multi day hike - I always try to do one a year 
## art
- read 6 novels - I think 1 book every 2 months is doable
- read 3 manga - this is to shift my prespective. I always considered reading manga unproductive even though I enjoy it, so I will make it a goal to read them
## skills
- Regain PPL currency - I was going to start this in 2022 but didn't get to it
- Functional python knowledge - I want to be able to think of a program and have the understanding to create it
- Make something with an arduino - whether its a small robot or something with a sensor, I just want to make something!
## money
- Save $2000 - I believe this is a reasonable goal to achieve while in grad school
## life 
- travel somewhere (either a small trip or big trip)
- Survive the first year of masters
