One of my new year's resolutions was to read six books this year, and I'm happy to say I'm starting this strong by finishing my first book in about two weeks. While in Vancouver, I visited MacLeod's bookstore and picked up a copy of Ender's Shadow. I read most of the original Ender series in 2021, and the Shadow saga had been on the list to read eventually. Ender's Shadow was one of the first books I saw in the store and I couldn't resist.

I'm typically not a fast reader, but something about this book had me blazing through it. Orson Scott Card's writing style is so fluid and I kept finding myself engrossed in the book. I couldn't put the last half down and had read about 200 pages in two days! It feels super refreshing to have been sucked into a book again. Back in elementary school and high school, I would chug through books like they were nothing. A new book every couple of weeks. When university hit, I didn't make time for reading anymore, except when I found books that really intrigued me. I've got the next one in the Shadow saga on hold at the library and I'm looking forward to starting it soon.

The next section may contain spoilers for the story. I want to summarize the book and the parts I enjoyed, so I can have a better time remembering them.

The story follows Bean, once an orphan on the streets of Rotterdam and his journey to become a commander and Ender's second in command. It was really interesting seeing how analytical Bean was. I also appreciated that it wasn't just "natural ability", but rather he was genetically changed to be smarter than everyone else. I loved reading the way he thought through new information he received and how he would relate it to his past experiences. This sounds like what every person does, but the way Bean did it felt different. It felt as though there was nothing subjective about Bean's recollections and that was fascinating to me. Following Bean through being a launchie, moving into an army and then commanding his own squad. Bean starts cold and calculating, but as he makes more friends, you can see him develop and become more human. What a fantastic read!
