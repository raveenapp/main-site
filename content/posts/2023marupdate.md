Welp... So much for updating at least monthly. I'm gonna combine this as a January and February update AND give an update about how the masters is going.

# January and February

## Fitness
- I got a tattoo in January so I waited until it fully healed before I went back to the gym. So basically from Christmas break until the third week of January I didn't work out. However, from that point on, I've gone 4 days a week and here is my progress by the end of March:
    - Bench: 135x4x5
    - Squat: 205x4x5
    - Deadlift: 250x4x5

- I've dubbed this year my "strong boy arc". I'm going to work on strength training and some cardio while focusing on keeping consistent above all else. 

## Art
- I finished 6 novels and 1 manga series between January and March. They are the first 6 books of the Shadow Saga by Orson Scott Card and Tokyo Ghoul. When I am done the last book, I'd like to write a retrospective about the series.

# Master Update
- The masters is going well. Sometimes I feel like I'm killing it and other times like I'm super behind. I have to remind myself that I'm just finishing my third month, progress will come as long as I keep working. Most of my focus this semester is towards class work and TAing but I am starting my literature review for thesis. I'm honestly surprised at how much time marking takes up. I think my biggest concern is finding enough relevant material for the review but I think I have to look at the scope of the project and adjust accordingly. Let's see how this month goes!
