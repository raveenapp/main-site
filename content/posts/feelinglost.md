Lately, I've felt like I have been in a rut. I show up where I need to, go through the motions of the work I should be doing, but I haven't been accomplishing much. This has started to make me feel lost. 

I think my rut stems from not having confidence in my abilities. I am anxious about making decisions for the projects I'm on and that is causing me to procrastinate on the work I'm supposed to do. I'm not really sure how I'm supposed to get over this feeling of insecurity. I broke the work I'm supposed to do down into smaller steps so hopefully, it feels manageable, but there's a larger roadblock I have to address.
