November came and went! Overall, it was a great month. Work went fine, I got to travel for a week and slowly chipping away at my goals. Just another month left in the year. Let's see how this goes!

## Fitness
- ~~Keep current workout schedule~~
- Kept my 4-day schedule all month except for the week I went travelling, will continue this into December

## Learning
- ~~Pickup Python Course and do a little every night~~ 
- Not a lot of progress made here, hard to commit time when I get home pretty late. BUT I have a plan for that

## Hobbies
- ~~Complete PSTAR exam to start process to regain flying currency~~
- No progress with the PSTAR yet, I will dedicate more time for it this month

## Arts
- ~~Finish Farenheit 451~~
- Just under halfway through, I made a new reading setup which will help me read more pages
- I did read the Acid Room though! 

That's all for this month!
