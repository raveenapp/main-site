This week I was walking from the bus to my desk and I was thinking about life. I felt like I was approaching a new idea who I am, like I was learning something about myself. My brain stopped right before the revelation and was left feeling like something was on the tip of my tongue. I was finishing a puzzle except I was missing the last piece. 

Then, I saw this video ([Bocchi & The Psychology of Inspiration (Lighting the Lighthouse) by Euro Brady](https://youtu.be/Qk7HSiOLV7Q)) and I thought about all the times I referenced this is for a “future Raveen”. A different raveen who is more knowledgeable or experienced. Why can’t that be current Raveen? What’s stopping me now? I am going to change the way I frame things in my mind. I will no longer make a separate version of Raveen that I am emulating or trying to be like. I am that Raveen in the present.
