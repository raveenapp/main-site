I would like to start making post reflecting on the upcoming month. Here, I'd plan my goals for the month, and then at the end of the month, I'd re-evaluate my progress. This way I can see if goals I set are realistic and achieveable or do I need to change my expectations.

Fitness:
- Keep current workout schedule

Learning:
- Pickup Python Course and do a little every night

Hobbies:
- Complete PSTAR exam to start process to regain flying currency

Arts:
- Finish Farenheit 451

I think keeping 1 goal in each of these categories is reasonable, and if I happen to complete it early, I'll add any extra things completed. Brb in a month
