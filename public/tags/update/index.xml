      <description>fitness go to the gym for 200 days this year - I don&amp;rsquo;t have a goal with weight or strength, I just want to keep consistency Go on a multi day hike - I always try to do one a year art read 6 novels - I think 1 book every 2 months is doable read 3 manga - this is shift my prespective. I always considered reading manga unproductive even though I enjoy it, so I will make it a goal to read them skills Regain PPL currency - I was going to start this in 2022 but didn&amp;rsquo;t get to it Functional python knowledge - I want to be able to think of a program and have the understanding to create it Make something with an arduino - whether its a small robot or something with a sensor, I just want to make something!</description>
