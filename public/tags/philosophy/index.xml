      <description>Over the last few years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been grappling with the idea of mundanity and finding meaning. A reoccurring thought I have is that in the macro sense, life is meaningless.

And even if I make a name for myself, my legacy will be forgotten in a few generations too.</description>
