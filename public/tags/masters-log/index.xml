      <description>While on the bus a month ago, I thought it would be cool to keep a written blog of my experiences while completing my masters. This would be an on-going &amp;ldquo;series&amp;rdquo; of posts that would share what I&amp;rsquo;m working on, any tools I&amp;rsquo;m using, my workflow, organization system or anything of the sort. I&amp;rsquo;d like to make a post every few weeks (but let&amp;rsquo;s see if that happens).
Current Plan I don&amp;rsquo;t start it until January so this plan is completely based on speaking to other grad students and reading online.</description>
