I always considered reading manga unproductive even though I enjoy it, so I will make it a goal to read them skills Regain PPL currency - I was going to start this in 2022 but didn&amp;rsquo;t get to it Functional python knowledge - I want to be able to think of a program and have the understanding to create it Make something with an arduino - whether its a small robot or something with a sensor, I just want to make something!</description>

      <description>At the start of 2022, I decided to keep a log of all the notiable events throughout the year. It&amp;rsquo;s easy for me to get caught up with the micro aspects of life and this log allowed me to put my year into perspective. To summarize this year, I:
graduated from undergrad, getting my iron ring started gliding again since the pandemic started backpacked Peru for 3 weeks worked for the Mechanical Engineering department with their techinicians was accepted to my mech eng masters program starting in January spent a week exploring Vancouver with a friend went to 8 concerts watched 16 shows, 7 movies and read 6 books hung out with countless friends, watched my friend get married, and ate lots of good food I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have remembered half of these things if it wasn&amp;rsquo;t for the log I kept, definitely a habit I want to continue into 2023.</description>

      <description>I would like to start making post reflecting on the upcoming month. Here, I&amp;rsquo;d plan my goals for the month, and then at the end of the month, I&amp;rsquo;d re-evaluate my progress. This way I can see if goals I set are realistic and achieveable or do I need to change my expectations.

Pickup Python Course and do a little every night Hobbies:

      <title>What&#39;s the point of this website?</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve explained the history of the development of this website and I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned on my about page that this website is a &amp;ldquo;mixture of a portfolio and a blog site&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;m going to take this post to explain in more detail my motivations for this site.
There was once what I like to call the &amp;ldquo;golden era of the internet&amp;rdquo;, which deserves a post of its own. But basically, from like the 90s to the late 2000s, everyone had their own website or forum to share their ideas and it was very decentralized.</description>
