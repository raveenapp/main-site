      <description>November came and went! Overall, it was a great month. Work went fine, I got to travel for a week and slowly chipping away at my goals. Just another month left in the year. Let&amp;rsquo;s see how this goes!
Fitness Keep current workout schedule Kept my 4-day schedule all month except for the week I went travelling, will continue this into December Learning Pickup Python Course and do a little every night Not a lot of progress made here, hard to commit time when I get home pretty late.</description>

Day 1 - The Start The trip started on a good note before I landed in the city. I had a lovely conversation on the flight with a social worker who was on their way to a conference. After we landed, I made my way to the Sky Train and bought a Compass Card.</description>

      <description>Over the last few years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been grappling with the idea of mundanity and finding meaning. A reoccurring thought I have is that in the macro sense, life is meaningless. To go into more detail, no matter what I do or what happens in my life, I and everyone I love will eventually die and be forgotten. And even if I make a name for myself, my legacy will be forgotten in a few generations too.</description>

      <description>The Goal The goal of this project is to get better with Python. I learned Python in my first year programming class and used a little bit over the years, but I would hesitate to say I have a &amp;ldquo;functional&amp;rdquo; knowledge of the language. My goal with this project is to develop a better foundation so I can apply it better.
1.0 Python Docs I am going to start with working through the Python docs (https://docs.</description>

      <description>I would like to start making post reflecting on the upcoming month. Here, I&amp;rsquo;d plan my goals for the month, and then at the end of the month, I&amp;rsquo;d re-evaluate my progress. This way I can see if goals I set are realistic and achieveable or do I need to change my expectations.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve explained the history of the development of this website and I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned on my about page that this website is a &amp;ldquo;mixture of a portfolio and a blog site&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;m going to take this post to explain in more detail my motivations for this site.
There was once what I like to call the &amp;ldquo;golden era of the internet&amp;rdquo;, which deserves a post of its own. But basically, from like the 90s to the late 2000s, everyone had their own website or forum to share their ideas and it was very decentralized.</description>

      <description>Completed: April 2022
This was my final year capstone project. The client for this project was a material sciences professor. For his research, his group completes many compressions tests of 3D printed components, so our project revolved around removing tedious parts of his project. There were different aspects of the testing process that we could have focused on, but we decided to make a robot that automates the queueing, loading and removal of test samples.</description>

      <description>Completed: April 2017
This was my first year group design project. The goal of the project was to design a gear train that would move two fingers open and close. We were constrained to a given area and we were also given a specific gear ratio that our train had to be.
There was a lot to learn from this project. This was my first design project so I expected to have hiccups, those hiccups turned out to bite the group in the butt later.</description>

      <description>Completed: April 2018
This project was in my second year, in the MECHENG 2C04 design course. The goal of the project was to design a moving robot that didn&amp;rsquo;t use wheels. The movement would be driven by motors but we had to create an alternative mechanism for the robot to move. The robot would also have to be able to walk over an obstacle of unknown height.
My group decided to use a gear train with rotating legs to allow the robot to move.</description>

      <description>Completed: April 2020
This project was for my third year, in the MECHENG 3E05 design course. The goal of the project was the design a product. The groups were given free reign on what to design, but an important aspect of the project was to make sure the design was justified using engineering calculations. The project was evaluated based on how well the calculations account for issues like buckling and bolt calculations.</description>

      <description>Completed: July 2021
This was my first personal project. During the summer, I decided I wanted to try making a self-balancing robot. I thought it would be a good introductory project to apply what I learned from my control systems course from the previous school term as well as learn a little more about arduinos and using motors.
The chassis was made using 3D printed pieces that were attached together with thermal set inserts and fasteners.</description>

      <description>Completed: August 2021
This project was completed while working as an Educational Assistant for the Mechanical Engineering Department at McMaster. The purpose of this lab was to teach students about design techniques when 3D printing and laser cutting. I was tasked with designing a car which utilized different kinds of parts or fasteners. Some parts were purposefully designed to be combursome to highlight the importance of design for assembly. The students then would assemble the kit and comment on what designed components worked well and didn&amp;rsquo;t work well.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve always liked the idea of having my own little piece of the internet (hence why its the tag line on home page). But I didn&amp;rsquo;t really commit to having my own website until I watched a CollegeInfoGeek video on it in 2017 (https://youtu.</description>
