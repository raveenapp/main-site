      <description>Completed: April 2017
This was my first year group design project. The goal of the project was to design a gear train that would move two fingers open and close. We were constrained to a given area and we were also given a specific gear ratio that our train had to be.
There was a lot to learn from this project. This was my first design project so I expected to have hiccups, those hiccups turned out to bite the group in the butt later.</description>

      <description>Completed: April 2018
This project was in my second year, in the MECHENG 2C04 design course. The goal of the project was to design a moving robot that didn&amp;rsquo;t use wheels. The movement would be driven by motors but we had to create an alternative mechanism for the robot to move. The robot would also have to be able to walk over an obstacle of unknown height.
My group decided to use a gear train with rotating legs to allow the robot to move.</description>

      <description>Completed: April 2020
This project was for my third year, in the MECHENG 3E05 design course. The goal of the project was the design a product. The groups were given free reign on what to design, but an important aspect of the project was to make sure the design was justified using engineering calculations. The project was evaluated based on how well the calculations account for issues like buckling and bolt calculations.</description>

      <title>Self Balancing Robot</title>

      <description>Completed: July 2021
This was my first personal project. During the summer, I decided I wanted to try making a self-balancing robot. I thought it would be a good introductory project to apply what I learned from my control systems course from the previous school term as well as learn a little more about arduinos and using motors.
The chassis was made using 3D printed pieces that were attached together with thermal set inserts and fasteners.</description>

      <description>Completed: August 2021
This project was completed while working as an Educational Assistant for the Mechanical Engineering Department at McMaster. The purpose of this lab was to teach students about design techniques when 3D printing and laser cutting. I was tasked with designing a car which utilized different kinds of parts or fasteners. Some parts were purposefully designed to be combursome to highlight the importance of design for assembly. The students then would assemble the kit and comment on what designed components worked well and didn&amp;rsquo;t work well.</description>
