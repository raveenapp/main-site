      <description>At the start of 2022, I decided to keep a log of all the notiable events throughout the year. It&amp;rsquo;s easy for me to get caught up with the micro aspects of life and this log allowed me to put my year into perspective. To summarize this year, I:
graduated from undergrad, getting my iron ring started gliding again since the pandemic started backpacked Peru for 3 weeks worked for the Mechanical Engineering department with their techinicians was accepted to my mech eng masters program starting in January spent a week exploring Vancouver with a friend went to 8 concerts watched 16 shows, 7 movies and read 6 books hung out with countless friends, watched my friend get married, and ate lots of good food I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have remembered half of these things if it wasn&amp;rsquo;t for the log I kept, definitely a habit I want to continue into 2023.</description>

      <title>Master&#39;s Log - 0</title>

      <description>While on the bus a month ago, I thought it would be cool to keep a written blog of my experiences while completing my masters. This would be an on-going &amp;ldquo;series&amp;rdquo; of posts that would share what I&amp;rsquo;m working on, any tools I&amp;rsquo;m using, my workflow, organization system or anything of the sort. I&amp;rsquo;d like to make a post every few weeks (but let&amp;rsquo;s see if that happens).
Current Plan I don&amp;rsquo;t start it until January so this plan is completely based on speaking to other grad students and reading online.</description>

      <title>Being Okay with Insignificance</title>

      <description>Over the last few years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been grappling with the idea of mundanity and finding meaning. A reoccurring thought I have is that in the macro sense, life is meaningless. To go into more detail, no matter what I do or what happens in my life, I and everyone I love will eventually die and be forgotten. And even if I make a name for myself, my legacy will be forgotten in a few generations too.</description>

      <description>I would like to start making post reflecting on the upcoming month. Here, I&amp;rsquo;d plan my goals for the month, and then at the end of the month, I&amp;rsquo;d re-evaluate my progress. This way I can see if goals I set are realistic and achieveable or do I need to change my expectations.
Fitness:
Keep current workout schedule Learning:
Pickup Python Course and do a little every night Hobbies:
Complete PSTAR exam to start process to regain flying currency Arts:</description>

      <title>What&#39;s the point of this website?</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve explained the history of the development of this website and I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned on my about page that this website is a &amp;ldquo;mixture of a portfolio and a blog site&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;m going to take this post to explain in more detail my motivations for this site.
There was once what I like to call the &amp;ldquo;golden era of the internet&amp;rdquo;, which deserves a post of its own. But basically, from like the 90s to the late 2000s, everyone had their own website or forum to share their ideas and it was very decentralized.</description>
