      <description>Over the last few years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been grappling with the idea of mundanity and finding meaning. A reoccurring thought I have is that in the macro sense, life is meaningless. To go into more detail, no matter what I do or what happens in my life, I and everyone I love will eventually die and be forgotten. And even if I make a name for myself, my legacy will be forgotten in a few generations too.</description>

Here, I&amp;rsquo;d plan my goals for the month, and then at the end of the month, I&amp;rsquo;d re-evaluate my progress. This way I can see if goals I set are realistic and achieveable or do I need to change my expectations.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve explained the history of the development of this website and I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned on my about page that this website is a &amp;ldquo;mixture of a portfolio and a blog site&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;m going to take this post to explain in more detail my motivations for this site.
There was once what I like to call the &amp;ldquo;golden era of the internet&amp;rdquo;, which deserves a post of its own. But basically, from like the 90s to the late 2000s, everyone had their own website or forum to share their ideas and it was very decentralized.</description>
